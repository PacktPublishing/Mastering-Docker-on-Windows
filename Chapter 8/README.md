# Chapter 8 – Standalone Files

This folder contains all standalone artefacts referenced in Chapter 8.

Each file maps directly to a figure or example in the chapter and is intended for reference,
experimentation, or reuse in enterprise Docker environments.

Nothing here is illustrative-only. All files are runnable with appropriate context.
